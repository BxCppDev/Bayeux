Development of emfield has migrated to Git


Bayeux/emfield  is  a  C++  program library  that  provides  a  simple
interface to describe electromagnetic  fields associated to a geometry
model.

EM fields described  through Bayeux/emfield can be used as  is by some
client  computing models  (ODE solvers...)  or made  available from  a
high-level interface like the Geant4 simulation engine.

Bayeux/emfield depends on the Bayeux/geomtools library.

Bayeux/emfield is distributed as a module of the Bayeux software suite.
