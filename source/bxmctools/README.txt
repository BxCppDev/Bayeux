mctools (Monte-Carlo Tools) is a C++ program library which provides
some utilities to  ease the generation of Monte-Carlo simulation data
particularly within the Geant4 simulation framework.  

mctools depends  on the  geomtools (and thus  mygsl and  datatools) C++
program library. It relies on the underlying CLHEP, GSL and Geant4 libraries.
