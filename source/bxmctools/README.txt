mctools (Monte-Carlo Tools) is a C++ program library which provides
some utilities to  ease the generation of Monte-Carlo simulation data
particularly within the Geant4 simulation framework.

mctools depends  on the  geomtools, mygsl, genvtx, genbb_help and  datatools C++
program library. It relies on the underlying CLHEP, GSL and Geant4 libraries.

mctools is distributed as a module of the Bayeux software suite.
