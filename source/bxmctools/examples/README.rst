Bayeux/mctools examples
=======================

List of examples :

 * ``ex00`` : This example illustrates how to build a full Geant4
   based Monte-Carlo simulation setup, including the geometry modelling,
   event and vertex generation and Monte-Carlo *true* hits processing.
 * ``ex01`` : This example illustrates how to build a full Geant4
   based Monte-Carlo simulation setup with a more complex geometry setup
   than in ``ex00``.
 * ``ex02`` : This example implements the tracking of a low energy
   charged ion in an electric field.
