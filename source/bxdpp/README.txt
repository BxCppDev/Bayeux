dpp (Data Processing Pipeline) is a C++ program library that implements
a data processing  pipeline model using the ``datatools::things`` generic
container as the main data model and facilities from the ``cuts`` library.

dpp  depends  on cuts,  brio,  mygsl  and  datatools from  the  Bayeux
software collection and third party software from the Cadfael software
collection.
