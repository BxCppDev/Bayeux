dpp (Data Processing Pipeline) is a C++ program library that implements
a data processing  pipeline model using the ``datatools::things`` generic
container as the main data model and facilities from the ``cuts`` library.

dpp  depends  on cuts,  brio,  mygsl  and  datatools from  the  Bayeux
software collection and third party software from the Cadfael software
collection.

dpp  is based on  some original  work in  the sncore  library (Falaise
software collection).
