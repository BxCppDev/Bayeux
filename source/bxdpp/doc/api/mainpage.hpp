 *
 * dpp  (Data  Processing Pipeline)  is  a  C++  program library  that
 * handles  a  data processing  pipeline  model  using the  datatools'
 * things  container  as  the  main  data  model  (event  record)  and
 * facilities from the cuts library.  
 *
 * dpp depends on  the cuts, brio, mygsl and  datatools libraries from
 * the Bayeux  software collection and  third party software  from the
 * Cadfael software collection (Boost, CLHEP, GSL, ROOT).
