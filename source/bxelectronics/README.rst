Bayeux/electronics
==================


Author: F.Mauger <mauger@lpccaen.in2p3.fr>

Introduction
------------

The  Bayeux/electronics  module  aims  to model  the  layout  of  a
frontend   electronics   system   for  an   nuclear/particle   physics
experiment: racks, crate, boards and embedded components like ASIC and
FPGA chips.


Note: 2013-11-22:

 * This is a preliminary implementation.
 * It is not integrated in Bayeux.


TODO:

 * A class to represent a data register (8,16... bits)
   and bit fields in it
 * Concept of component I/O (analog/digital)
   with specific traits and addressing scheme (link to GID)
 * Concept of cables and connectors...
