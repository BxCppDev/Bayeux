  Version ROOT 5.28.00:

  From http://root.cern.ch/root/v528/Version528.news.html#core :

  In order to fix possible  buffer overflow of parent string buffer in
  TMemberInspector, the  signature of  ShowMember() was changed  to no
  longer  require (nor  request) the  caller to  provide a  buffer (of
  length unknown to the callee.)

  Dictionnary needs to be generated at compile time.
