Presentation :

The Quasi  Portable Input Output Binary Archives  classes provide some
(de)serialization media based  on the Boost/Serialization approach. it
makes possible to serialize  and deserialize arbitrary data structures
(classes, native types, pointers) in Boost archives using a binary and
portable format.   Strict portability is  hard to ensure, thus  we use
the  'quasi-portable'  idiom.   It  is expected  full  portability  is
effective  for most  architectures  we  use in  the  framework of  our
software activities (with existing uint64_t).

It is  possible to  save/load booleans, integral  types (8 bits  to 64
bits, signed or unsigned), float,  double in a portable way (including
NaN, +/-infinity for floats and doubles), strings...

You need Boost 1.44 with Boost/Serialization version 7. Previous Boost
versions are not supported.

This work is based on former work by :
- Christian Pfligersdorffer <christian.pfligersdorffer@eos.info>. 
  the author of the original eos::portable_[i/o]archive classes
- Robert Ramey (http://www.rrsd.com)
  the author of the Boost/Serialization library
- Beman  Dawes for the endian library
- Johan Rade for the fp_utilities

This is the basic directory for the QPBA source files.

It  contains the  original source  code of  the quasi  portable binary
archives and test programs.

Unless you know  what you are doing, you should  not modify the source
code as it is a critical part  of the I/O system and we need to ensure
the portability and perennity of old serialized data for long period.
