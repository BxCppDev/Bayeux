CAUTION :

This is the basic directory for QPBA classes development.

It contains the original source code of the quasi portable
binary archives and test programs.

Only the maintener of the package is allowed to modify
source code in it as it is the original source of what we
release in the datatools package.

History:

The "boost/archive/basic_archive.hpp" defines the following classes : 

- library_version_type
- version_type
- class_id_type
  - class_id_reference_type (BOOST_ARCHIVE_STRONG_TYPEDEF)
  - class_id_optional_type (BOOST_ARCHIVE_STRONG_TYPEDEF)
- object_id_type
  - object_reference_type (BOOST_ARCHIVE_STRONG_TYPEDEF)
- tracking_type

All must be given archive save/load overloaded methods
to ensure portable (de)serialization of the integer
attributes they host.
