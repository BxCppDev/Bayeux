README -- The Boost/Serialization Portable Binary Archive Tutorial

This directory contains the source  code and the scripts used to build
the  PBA HTML  tutorial. It  has been  designed to  run in  Linux with
the help of various standard tools:

 - GNU bash (to prepare the final HTML source tree)
 - GNU recode (to manipulate special charsets)
 - GNU enscript (to prepare HTML rendering of the C++ sample programs)
 - GNU awk (to extract HTML snippet from the enscript output)
 - GNU m4 (to generate the main HTML page)
 - GNU make (to automate the build sequence)
 - firefox (to browse the HTML page)

A  recent version  of  the Boost  library  (1.47.0) and  gcc (>4)  are
required to build the sample programs,  run them on the build host and
format their output to be integrated within the HTML tutorial page.

The  author usually  performs the  build on  a Ubuntu  Linux (>=11.04).
However,  provided  the proper  tools  are  installed  and setup,  any
*nix-like system should be okay.

How to build the tutorial HTML tree :

shell> make
shell> make install
