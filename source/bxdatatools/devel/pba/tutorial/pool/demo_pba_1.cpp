     * Understanding the format of portable binary archive(s) :
     *
     * It is possible to display the byte contents of the output file 
     * using some dedicated tool (here the 'od' program available from the
     * GNU coreutils package under Linux):
     *
     *   unix-shell> od -t u1 demo_pba_1.data | tr -s [[:space:]] | cut -d ' ' -f2- | head -3
     *   127 1 9 0 1 84 0 255 253 1 6 255 240 1 32 255
     *   128 1 127 254 0 252 2 0 8 4 208 15 73 64 8 116
     *   87 20 139 10 191 5 64
     * 
     * Detailed comments about the format :
     *
     *   127       : The conventional `magic' byte of the portable binary archive(s)
     *   1 9       : Boost archive version number value is 9 and it is encoded  using 1 storage byte
     *               Here a dedicated scheme for binary encoding of integer numbers is used
     *               (see below for other examples)
     *   0         : b0 == false (0)
     *   1 84      : b1 == true is encoded using 1 storage byte with conventional 
     *               value 84 (ASCII character 'T')
     *   0         : c0 == 0 (using only 1 byte with zero optimization )
     *   255 253   : where 255 -> -1 means a negative integer using 1 storage byte
     *               and value c = -3 (as an unsigned byte 11111101 -> 253)
     *   1 6       : uc == +6 (as a positive integer number using 1 storage byte)
     *   255 240   : where 255 -> -1 means a negative integer using 1 storage byte
     *               and value s = -16 (as an unsigned byte 11110000 -> 240)
     *   1 32      : us == +32 (as a positive integer number using 1 storage byte)
     *   255 128   : where 255 -> -1 means a negative integer using 1 storage byte
     *               and value l = -128 (as an unsigned byte 10000000 -> 128)
     *   1 127     : ul == +127 (as a positive integer number using 1 storage byte)
     *   254 0 252 : where 254 -> -2 means a negative integer using 2 storage bytes
     *               and bytes 252 + 0 (in reversed order we have binary = 11111100/00000000, 
     *               match a positive integer number == 64512) 
     *               it gives the value ll = 64512 - 65536 = -1024
     *   2 0 8     : where 2 means a positive integer using 2 storage bytes
     *               and bytes 8 + 0 (binary = 00001000.00000000) give
     *               value ull = 2048
     *   4 208 15 73 64 : 
     *               where 4 is the number of bytes used for a IEEE 754 encoded
     *               single precison floating number.
     *               the encoding is interpreted after bytes reordering :
     *               64 73 15 208 which corresponds to
     *               [0](1000000 0){1.1001001 00001111 11010000}
     *               with :
     *               * [0] is the sign bit
     *               * (10000000) is the 8-bit exponent == 128 to be shift by 127
     *                 thus 2^(128-127) = 2
     *               * {1.1001001 00001111 1101 0000} is the significant (mantissa)
     *                 note: `1.' is the conventional 'phantom' bit which is not stored.
     *                 Thus the significant part is:
     *                 1 + 1/2 + 1/16 + 1/128 + 1/4096 + 1/8192 + 1/16384
     *                   + 1/32768 + 1/65536 + 1/131072 + 1/524288 == 1.570795059
     *                Finally: f == + 2 * 1.570795059 = 3.141590118 (within a 1e^-7 roundoff error)
     *   8 116 87 20 139 10 191 5 64 : 
     *               where 8 is the number of bytes used for a IEEE 754 encoded
     *               double precison floating number. The same scheme is used as for 
     *               single precision  floating numbers but using 1 sign bit, 11-bit exponent
     *               and 52-bit mantissa.
