<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
The <i>Boost Serialization</i> 
<!-- <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_38_0/libs/serialization/doc/index.html"
target="_empty">Boost.Serialization</a> --> 
library offers  a powerful
tool to  store/load arbitrary  data using dedicated  formatted medium
objects known as
<i>archives</i>. Archives are attached to input/output streams. This naturally enables the use of
<i>filestreams</i> as privileged data storage devices. The Boost Serialization library implements a few
formatted input/ouput archives: <i>Text</i>, <i>XML</i> and <i>Portable binary</i>
rendering formats. Archives supporting other rendering formats can be designed by the programmer.
</p>

<p>
This note concerns a special serialization strategy based on Boost
archives. I refer to it as the <i>multiple archive per (file)stream</i>
approach  that can be used to workaround some issues induced
by the object tracking machanism. 
Let's first explain the motivations for this work.

<h3>Object tracking</h3>

<!-- ******************************************************** -->

<a href="Object_tracking__Introduction"></a>
<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>
The Boost Serialization library has a special mechanism known as
<i>object tracking</i> (or  <i>object memory tracking</i>). It enables
to store/load data  in a smart and efficient  way. Using this feature,
if  a <i>datum</i>  (typically an  instance of  a class)  is addressed
through different pointers and one  wants to store the data referenced
by such collection of pointers, thus  the datum is stored only once in
the target archive, avoiding the  duplication of storage. On the other
hand,  during  archive  deserialization  (loading) process,  only  one
instance  of the  datum will  be restored  and possibly  many pointers
referencing it will be dynamically initialized with the unique address
of this single datum.
</p>

<p>
As  an  example,  consider  <a  href="#fig1">figure  1</a>  where  the
<tt>foo</tt> container (top  of the figure) owns a  list of 5 pointers
that reference  only 3 <tt>fuu</tt> instances. Archiving  the full set
of  pointers <u>without</u>  memory tracking  leads to  the replicated
storage of  both the second  and third <tt>fuu</tt> instances  (top to
bottom left  flow on the figure).  Using  archiving <u>with</u> memory
tracking  only  stores the  minimal  amount  of  data: 3  <tt>fuu</tt>
instances plus  the minimal informations that  indicates that pointers
<tt>#2</tt>   and  <tt>#4</tt>  respectively   reference  <tt>fuu</tt>
instances 1 and 2 (top to bottom right flow on the figure). 
</p>

<p>
More  the deserialization  process  without memory  tracking does  not
restore the  original data structure  (see the bottom  <tt>foo</tt> on
the figure) while  using memory tracking ensures the  proper backup of
the original data (bottom to top right flow).
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
This illustrates  that the object  memory tracking system can  be very
useful or  even necessary, depending  on your application.   Note that
the Boost serialization library provides some tools to activate or not
this feature, typically on a per class basis.
</p>

<p>
In  this  note   I  will  consider  the  case   where  an  application
<u>needs</u> to serialize data through the Boost serialization library
<u>with</u> object memory tracking.
</p>

<!-- ******************************************************** -->

<a href="Object_tracking__Issues"></a>
<h4>Issues</h4>

<p>
The  use of  this  very  useful and  powerful  object memory  tracking
mechanism may however have  some nasty side-effects.  Depending on the
data model  to be stored (or  loaded), and without  special care, some
data  corruption can  (will)  occur along  the serialization  process.
This is because the tracking system has a special policy that triggers
the serialization  of data  stored from some  memory location  only if
this memory location has not been visited (used) before.
</p>

<p>
It means  that during the  serialization process, if  some dynamically
allocated  memory location  has been  previously used  to  handle data
<tt>X</tt> which has already been serialized, the reuse of this memory
location  for  anoter  data   <tt>Y</tt>  is  likely  to  corrupt  the
storage/load flow  of <tt>Y</tt>.  The memory  tracking algorithm will
consider  <tt>Y</tt>   as  the  same  data  as   the  previously  used
<tt>X</tt>, even if  <tt>Y</tt> has nothing to do  with <tt>X</tt> and
consists in a  new dataset.  This generally induces  loss of data that
exists in memory but is <i>skipped</i> by the memory tracker which may
silently reconstruct  some wrong references to data.   Of course, this
is  not what  we want!  The  example given  below should  help you  to
understand this issue.
</p>

<a href="Object_tracking__Example"></a>
<h4>Example</h4>

<p><a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a> illustrates  this special case where 2
<tt>foo</tt>  collections, <tt>foo #0</tt>  and <tt>foo  #1</tt>, that
simultaneously  coexist in  memory,  owns through  pointers their  own
independant  set of  <tt>fuu</tt> objects.  Now consider  the  case of
storing both collections  in the same Boost archive.   In this example
and  for  simplicity,  we  consider  the  only  serialization  of  the
<tt>fuus</tt> list, not the <tt>sum</tt> and <tt>max_fuu</tt> fields!
</p>
<p>
<table align="center"><tr><td>
<a name="fig2"></a> 
<img src="./images/foo_2.png" border="0">
<br>
Figure 2
</td></tr></table><br>
</p>

<p>
At the  end of the serialization  of both <tt>foo  #0</tt> and <tt>foo
#1</tt> collections,  the archive contains all  data representing both
<tt>foo</tt>  instances.  All  the memory  locations  (addresses) have
been visited by the memory tracking system. This is represented by red
color squares in the upper  left corner of the <tt>fuu</tt> objects in
<a  href="#fig3">figure  3</a>.  Here  we  are  satisfied because  the
archive has been generated properly, and we don't care about the final
state of the memory tracker system.
</p>
<p>
<table align="center"><tr><td>
<a name="fig3"></a> 
<img src="./images/foo_2b.png" border="0">
<br>
Figure 3
</td></tr></table><br>
</p>

<p>
But wait!  There is another way to  <i>manipulate</i> our <tt>foo</tt>
collections.  Let's  consider <a  href="#fig4">figure  4</a> when  you
first create the <tt>foo #0</tt> instance alone, populate it with some
<tt>fuu</tt>  objects then  immediately  serialize it  in the  archive
using memory tracking:
</p>
<p>
<table align="center"><tr><td>
<a name="fig4"></a> 
<img src="./images/foo_2c.png" border="0">
<br>
Figure 4
</td></tr></table><br>
</p>
<p>
Up to  now, everything  is fine!  After  the serialization  of <tt>foo
#0</tt>, you  get a preliminary  archive and the tracking  system have
visited the  4 addresses corresponding  to the 4  <tt>fuu</tt> objects
within <tt>foo #0</tt>. This is  shown again by the red filled squared
in <a href="#fig4">figure 5</a>:
</p>
<table align="center"><tr><td>
<a name="fig5"></a> 
<p>
<img src="./images/foo_2d.png" border="0">
<br>
Figure 5
</td></tr></table><br>
</p>

<p>
Now you  decide to delete  the <tt>foo #0</tt> collection  from memory
and  allocate  the new  <tt>foo  #1</tt>  collection  with all  its  3
<tt>fuu</tt>  items in  it.  <a  href="#fig4">Figure 6</a>  shows this
case  where   the  freshly  deleted  <tt>foo   #0</tt>  collection  is
represented  with light  blue contour  and the  new  allocated <tt>foo
#1</tt> is ready for serialization in order to terminate the archiving
process. As it can be seen  on the picture, the memory tracking system
keeps some <i>red</i> flags on the memory locations previously used by
<tt>fuu</tt> items  in the former <tt>foo #0</tt>  collection. The new
<tt>foo #1</tt> collection has not  been serialized yet, so the memory
location have  not been  visited by the  memory tracker  (green filled
squares).
</p>
<p>
<table align="center"><tr><td>
<a name="fig6"></a> 
<img src="./images/foo_2e.png" border="0">
<br>
Figure 6
</td></tr></table><br>
</p>
Now  let's  serialize  <tt>foo   #1</tt>,  we  get  the  following  <a
href="#fig7">picture</a>:
</p>
<p>
<table align="center"><tr><td>
<a name="fig7"></a> 
<img src="./images/foo_2f.png" border="0">
<br>
Figure 7
</td></tr></table><br>
</p>
<p>
This final  situation is strictly the same  than the one we  got in <a
href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>. The archive  is completed with the expected
data. So, everything is fine! Hum, we were just lucky!
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we definitively cannot  rely on the picture shown in
<a href="#fig6">figure 6</a>.   Let's see why!  Now have  a look on <a
href="#fig8">figure 8</a> that shows the (realistic) case where one of
the <tt>fuu</tt>  item in the <tt>foo #1</tt>  collection is allocated
at some location that have been already visited by the memory tracking
system while  serializing <tt>foo  #0</tt>. Be sure  that in  the real
there is no way to prevent such event on your system (unless you add a
special memory management system on top of the default one that should
be aware of Boost serialization memory tracking system's state):
</p>
<p>
<table align="center"><tr><td>
<a name="fig8"></a> 
<img src="./images/foo_2g.png" border="0">
<br>
Figure 8
</td></tr></table><br>
</p>
<p>
So, let's try to serialize <tt>foo #1</tt> in the same archive than
the one used for <tt>foo #0</tt> serialization!
<a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a> shows what we get:
</p>
<p>
<table align="center"><tr><td>
<a name="fig9"></a> 
<img src="./images/foo_2h.png" border="0">
<br>
Figure 9
</td></tr></table><br>
</p>

<p>
As  you  can  see,  the  memory tracking  system,  following  its  own
algorithm, generates  an archive internal reference  to the serialized
<tt>fuu #1</tt>  item of the serialized <tt>foo  #0</tt> collection in
place of storing the real <tt>fuu #1</tt> data that belongs to <tt>foo
#1</tt>!   This is  not the  same result  than the  one we  got  in <a
href="#fig7">figure 7</a>.  The archive  is now corrupted and there is
no way to restore the original data structure.
</p>

<p>
It  is easy  to  imagine  the consequence  of  the deserialization  of
<tt>foo #0</tt> and <tt>foo  #1</tt> collection using this archive (<a
href="#fig10">figure  10</a>): the  data will  be nested  with invalid
crossed references.  The <tt>fuu==0.2</tt> value in <tt>foo #1</tt> is
definitively  lost.  More  if we  consider that  the  <tt>sum</tt> and
<tt>max_fuu</tt>  fields have  also  been serialized,  then we  cannot
trust their respective restored values in <tt>foo #1</tt>.
</p>
<p>
<table align="center"><tr><td>
<a name="fig10"></a> 
<img src="./images/foo_2i.png" border="0">
<br>
Figure 10
</td></tr></table><br>
</p>

<p>
The conclusion we  can draw from this basic  example is the following:
the success of serialization depends  on the way the memory allocation
and serialization  operations are  performed.  As we  generally cannot
control  the  memory locations  used  by  the  memory manager  of  the
operating system,  some memory addresses  are likely to be  reused and
<i>tracked</i>, particularly for application that handle large sets of
dynamically allocated data. The result is then unpredictible. 
</p>

<p>
The  two algorithms  shown  in the  following <a  href="#table1">table
1</a> will thus generally lead to different results while using memory
tracking through serialization,  the one on the right  being likely to
produce some corrupted archive:

<p>
Do  we have solutions  to avoid  such an  effect with  minimal effort,
still benefiting of the object tracking features ?  Yes we do. This is
the point of the next sections.
</p>

<!-- ******************************************************** -->

<!--
<p>
Of course, the object tracking  mechanism can be deactivated on demand
by the  user on a per-class  basis. However there  are reasons
why one does not want to proceed without tracking.  For a class
released within  a library,  one cannot reasonably  assume/enforce the
strategy  used by  end-users for  serializing instances  of  this class
within his/her own application. Particularly, object tracking has nice
and efficient features which the user may wish to rely on.  So we are left
with this dilemna: we need the object tracking mechanism on 
but we don't want the data corruption damages that come with it 
as described above. 
</p>

<hr>
<a name="Brute_force_approach"></a>
<h3>Brute force approach</h3>

<p>
The  so-called brute-force solution  to this  problem consists  in the
usage of some  container &mdash; for example STL list  can be used for
that  purpose  &mdash;  that  hosts  simultaneously  <b>all</b>  fully
allocated instances and their internally sub-data to be serialized.
</p>

<p>
To  illustrate  a  case  of  interest, assume  we  have  many  objects
<tt>A</tt>,    <tt>B</tt>...<tt>Z</tt>    to    be   serialized    (<a
href="#fig11">figure 11</a>), each of them implementing a complex data
model with internal dynamically allocated sub-objects (let's call them
<tt>a</tt>, <tt>b</tt>...  for the <tt>A</tt> object and so on).  More
the   <tt>A</tt>   object    may   host   pointers   referencing   its
sub-objects. This  justifies the use of the  object tracking approach.
We assume also  there is no cross-reference between  the memory scopes
owned  by instances <tt>A</tt>,  <tt>B</tt>...<tt>Z</tt> which  so are
completely independant.
</p>


<p> 
<table align="center"><tr><td>
<a name="fig11"></a> <img src="./images/foo_4.png" border="0"> 
<br> 
Figure 11
</td></tr></table><br>
</p>

<p>
The serialization process can be splitted in several steps: 
<ol> 

<li>Initialize the container.
<p>
<table align="center"><tr><td>
<a name="fig12"></a> 
<img src="./images/foo_4a_0.png" border="0">
<br>
Figure 12
</td></tr></table><br>
</p>

<li>Fill the container (<tt>push_back</tt>, <tt>insert</tt>...)
with objects properly initialized <tt>A</tt>,
<tt>B</tt>... <tt>Z</tt> (<a href="#fig13">figure 13</a>). One garantees that no dynamically allocated
memory location  is reused while skipping  from scope <tt>A</tt> to  <tt>B</tt> or
<tt>Z</tt>  instances  because  sub-objects  <tt>a</tt>,
<tt>b</tt>... in <tt>A</tt>, <tt>e</tt>,
<tt>f</tt>... in <tt>B</tt> and <tt>v</tt>,
<tt>w</tt>... in <tt>Z</tt>  simultaneously coexists in memory at
<u>different</u> locations. 
<p>
<table align="center"><tr><td>
<a name="fig13"></a> 
<img src="./images/foo_4b.png" border="0">
<br>
Figure 13
</td></tr></table><br>
</p>

<li>At this step, no memory will be freed &mdash; and possibly
reused &mdash; till the end of the
serialization process. The state of the memory related to our data is <u>frozen</u>. 

<li>Initialize the archive with its associated output stream.

<li>Traverse the  container and serialize  all items in it.   <br> For
this, you  should not perform  a single intermediate operation  on the
container's items  that could modify  the internal state  of allocated
memory  during this iterative  process: remove  or/and add  objects or
sub-objects.   <br> If  one uses  a STL  container supported  by Boost
serialization (<code>std::map</code>, <code>std::list</code>...), then
it is straightforward.  <br> The  archive is thus a static snapshot of
the memory layout of the whole data set.

<li>Now you can terminate the archive and close its associated stream.

<li>Finally you can clear the container and all objects in it.  

</ol> 

<p>
Now  you have your archive  stored typically in a  file with the
layout shown on <a  href="#fig14">figure 14</a>: 
</p>

<p> 
<table align="center"><tr><td>
<a name="fig14"></a> 
<img  src="./images/foo_5.png"   border="0">  
<br>
Figure 14
</td></tr></table><br>
</p>

This approach is safe.  However, it has counterparts: 

<ul>

<li>One must know in advance the full set of objects to be serialized.

<li>One cannot  modify the dataset (free/allocate  internal memory) as
soon as the serialization process is running.

<li>The full set of objects must be stored in memory and it may induce
a  huge  memory  footprint!   Particularly, during  the  serialization
iterative  process, there  is no  hope to  delete parts  of previously
serialized objects  in order to  save memory storage without  taking a
strong risk of data corruption.

<!--li>Object  tracking  implies  the  <i>bookkeeping</i> of  many,  many
memory locations  maybe at the  cost of some inefficiency  (this point
needs confirmation from Robert Ramey). -->

</ul> 

It is obvious that  within some applications (asynchronous source/flow
of  data, memory  limitation...),  this brute  force  approach is  not
satisfactory.
</p>


<hr>
<a name="A_smart_approach"></a>
<h3>A smart approach: using multiple archives per storage stream/file</h3>

<p>
Now it's time to describe a simple but elegant strategy to prevent our
application from what  one may call <i>far memory  scope tracking data
corruption  effects</i>  (note  that   the  term  <i>far</i>  is  very
subjective  and  should be  understood  as  <i>not confined</i>).   It
relies on the following  observation: the memory tracking mechanism is
<i>confined</i> within an archive.  It means that if some complex data
structure  <tt>A</tt>  (with  nested  dynamically  allocated  internal
sub-objects) is serialized  through its own archive, there  is no risk
of data corruption  by the memory traking process  if another instance
<tt>B</tt> is  serialized through a different  archive: memory traking
is always  reset at creation  of a new  archive : all red  squares get
green again!. 



<p>
A   new    serialization   strategy    is   then   proposed    on   <a
href="#fig15">figure  15</a>   with  the  following   layout  for  the
serialization  medium: <p  align="center">  <a name="fig15"></a>  <img
src="./images/foo_5b.png" border="0"> <br> Figure 15
</p>

<p> The main idea is to  use one archive for each instance <tt>A</tt>,
<tt>B</tt>...   <tt>Z</tt>  and store  all  archives  within the  same
stream.
</p>

<p>Now it is possible to use the following algorithm:
<ol> 

<li> Opening of the serialization stream,

<li> <tt>A</tt> management:
<ul>
<li> Initialize a Boost archive attached to the stream and dedicated to <tt>A</tt>,

<li> Create and manipulated <tt>A</tt> which is a complex data
  structure
  with many pointers in  it  referencing   other  dynamically  allocated  internal  objects
(<tt>a</tt>, <tt>b</tt>...),

<li> Serialize <tt>A</tt>

<li> Terminate the Boost archive dedicated to <tt>A</tt>,

<li> Delete/terminate <tt>A</tt>

</ul>

<li> <tt>B</tt> management:
<ul>
<li> Initialize a Boost archive attached to the stream and dedicated to <tt>B</tt>,


<li> Create and manipulated <tt>B</tt> which is a complex data
  structure
  with many pointers in  it  referencing   other  dynamically  allocated  internal  objects
(<tt>e</tt>, <tt>f</tt>...),

<li> Serialize <tt>B</tt>

<li> Terminate the Boost archive dedicated to <tt>B</tt>,

<li> Delete/terminate <tt>B</tt>
</ul>
...
<li> <tt>Z</tt> management:
<ul>
<li> Initialize a Boost archive attached to the stream and dedicated to <tt>Z</tt>,

<li> Create and manipulated <tt>Z</tt> which is a complex data
  structure
  with many pointers in  it  referencing   other  dynamically  allocated  internal  objects
(<tt>v</tt>, <tt>w</tt>...),

<li> Serialize <tt>Z</tt>

<li> Terminate the Boost archive dedicated to <tt>Z</tt>

<li> Delete/terminate <tt>Z</tt>
</ul>

<li> Closing the serialization stream. 

</ol>


<p>
This approach  still takes benefit  of memory traking  features within
each successive  archives, ensuring confinement of  memory tracking in
the memory  scope of a single  object.  But no  data corruption is
experienced  as  the  nasty  side-effect  of  unavoidable  dynamically
allocated memory reuse is not  possible anymore.  One can safely reuse
the  same   memory  location   to  store  the   instances  <tt>A</tt>,
<tt>B</tt>...  and   iterate  through  it   during  the  serialization
process. Data  can be manipulated between  serialization actions. That
makes easy and safe the use of an iterative loop with a reasonable small
memory footprint: 
</p>

<p>
<ol> 
<li>create an object 
<li>manipulate the object
<li>create the archive 
<li>store the object within its own archive
<li>terminate the archive 
<li>loop back to step 2...  
</ol>
</p>

<p>
What  about performances  and possible  advantages as  we now  use one
archive per object ?  Well, it  depends on many factors, but typically,
if the objects <tt>A</tt>, <tt>B</tt>... are so huge and numerous, the
memory footprint due to the  use of many archives is rather negligible
on the storage medium (Boost serialization archive headers and footers
are small).

<!--Probably  one  should get  CPU  advantages  concerning the  memory
tracking process because the memory size and associated combinatory is
reduced  within  each  archive  (However,  I'm  not  sure  about  this
point).--> 

More, objects being  isolated within their own archives  stored in the
same stream,  it is quite easy to  concatenate different serialization
streams or  split one in  several smaller ones  (one can easily  do it
with text or xml archive through simple scripts).
</p>

<p>
Of course,  the <i>multiple archives per file</i>  strategy makes 
sense only if  the instances <tt>A</tt>, <tt>B</tt>... to be
serialized 
are totally independant (without any cross-referenced data).

<p>Some sample programs are provided in order to illustrate the 
coupling of Boost serialization with the object memory tracking
mechanism: possible
issues (examples <a href="#example:1">1</a> and <a href="#example:3">3</a>) and proposed strategies  to fix the problems
explained above (examples <a href="#example:2">2</a> and <a href="#example:4">4</a>). They 
compile with Boost 1.38.0 and gcc 4.2.4 under Linux and are likely to
do so using other platforms.
</p>

<p>
File <a href="../foo.hpp"><i>foo.hpp</i></a> 
implements a <tt>foo</tt> class 
with Boost serialization support. A <tt>foo</tt>  object
contains a <tt>__fuus</tt> list of pointers to dynamically 
allocated <tt>fuu</tt> objects.
More there is a <tt>__sum</tt> field whom  value is
computed to be the sum of values belonging to the <tt>fuu</tt> items
in the <tt>__fuus</tt> list. Also a <tt>__max_fuu</tt> pointer
references the <tt>fuu</tt> item with the largest value.
The <tt>foo</tt> class is responsible of the deletion of <tt>fuu</tt>
items in the <tt>__fuus</tt> list. No memory deallocation is performed
for the  <tt>__max_fuu</tt> pointer that is considered as a weak reference.
Just for educationnal purpose, there is special added code 
for debugging  and doing statistics 
on memory usage.
</p>

</p>

<p>
File <a href="../foo_light.hpp"><i>foo_light.hpp</i></a> is a clone
of <i>foo.hpp</i> without the tools for debugging and doing statistics 
on memory usage.
</p>

<p>
The programs below manipulate some XML  archives to store
data  from <i>foo.hpp</i>. They also print statistics on memory usage. These last
informations can be used to understand the cases
where object tracking produces serialized data corruption.
</p>

<p>
Examples:
</p>

<ol>

<li> 
<a name="example:1"></a>
Example of data/memory corruption due to object memory tracking:<br>

<ul>
<li><a href="../tracking_write_0.cpp"><i>tracking_write_0.cpp</i></a>
generates a file <i>data_0.xml</i> with an XML archive that contains
5  <tt>foo</tt>  objects.  The   archive  is  silently  generated  and
corrupted by  object tracking.   A tool inside  the program  gives the
status  of reused  memory  locations, it  proves  the data  corruption
process in the archive.

<li><a href="../tracking_read_0.cpp"><i>tracking_read_0.cpp</i></a>:
attempts to load (deserialize) the 5 <tt>foo</tt> objects previously
serialized by the <i>tracking_write_0.cpp</i> program (input file: <i>data_0.xml</i>). 
It fails at some point through a  memory dynamic management error.

<li><a
href="../tracking_write_1.cpp"><i>tracking_write_1.cpp</i></a>:
a variant of the  <i>tracking_write_0.cpp</i> program that generates
the <i>data_1.xml</i> archive file which is a clone of  <i>data_0.xml</i>.
</ul>
<br>

<li><a name="example:2"></a>
 Brute force solution to prevent data corruption:<br>
<ul>

<li><a
href="../tracking_write_2.cpp"><i>tracking_write_2.cpp</i></a>:
generate the XML archive file <i>data_2.xml</i>, but arrange
not to  reused memory location while traversing a list of
5 <tt>foo</tt> objects. It uses a <tt>std::list</tt>
instance  for that. The memory tracker indicates no reuse of any
memory location. The archive is NOT corrupted.

<li><a href="../tracking_read_2.cpp"><i>tracking_read_2.cpp</i></a>:
load the <tt>foo</tt> objects from file  <i>data_2.xml</i>
using a <tt>std::list</tt> instance.
Everything works well. 

</ul>

This brute force approach produces reversible
serialization/deserialization operations at the cost
of a larger used memory.
<br>
<br>

<li><a name="example:3"></a> Not using object memory tracking implies
some memory leakage:<br>
<ul>
<li><a
href="../tracking_write_3.cpp"><i>tracking_write_3.cpp</i></a>:
is similar to program <i>tracking_write_0.cpp</i> but
does not use object memory tracking thanks to a special Boost
serialization directive. The output is not corrupted
but some data are replicated in the <i>data_3.xml</i>
output file.

<li><a href="../tracking_read_3.cpp"><i>tracking_read_3.cpp</i></a>:
load the <tt>foo</tt> objects from file  <i>data_3.xml</i>.
Everything looks okay but it implies memory leakage
at deletion of <tt>foo</tt> instances. 

</ul>
<br>
<li><a name="example:4"></a> Smart solution: using multiple archive within one file <u>with</u> memory tracking.<br>
<ul>
<li><a
href="../tracking_write_4.cpp"><i>tracking_write_4.cpp</i></a>:
is similar to program <i>tracking_write_0.cpp</i> but
use one archive per <tt>foo</tt> instance 
<u>and</u> object memory tracking. The output is not corrupted
and no data is replicated in the <i>data_4.xml</i>
output file.

<li><a href="../tracking_read_4.cpp"><i>tracking_read_4.cpp</i></a>:
load the <tt>foo</tt> objects from file  <i>data_4.xml</i>.
The serialized/unserialized data are not 
corrupted. There is no memory leakage. There is no need of a special
container to handle all  <tt>foo</tt> objects simultaneously. 
Everything is okay. 

</ul>
