genvtx (generator of vertexes) is a C++ program library which provides
some utilities to  ease the generation of randomized  vertexes in a 3D
geometry.  It  aims to be used  at the generation of  primary event in
tools such as GEANT4 or whatever other physics simulation library. 

genvtx depends  on the  geomtools (and thus  mygsl and  datatools) C++
program library. It relies on the underlying CLHEP and GSL libraries.
