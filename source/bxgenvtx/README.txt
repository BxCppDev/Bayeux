genvtx (generator of vertexes) is a C++ program library which provides
some utilities to  ease the generation of randomized  vertexes in a 3D
geometry.  It  aims to be used  at the generation of  primary events in
tools such as GEANT4 or whatever other physics simulation library.

genvtx depends  on the  geomtools,  mygsl and  datatools C++
program libraries.

genvtx is distributed as a module of the Bayeux software suite.
