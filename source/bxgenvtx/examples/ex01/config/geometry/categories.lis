#@description A list of geometry ID categories/types
#@key_label   "category"

# This is the mother-of-all geometry category
# that addresses the "World" volume (mandatory):
[category="world" type="0"]
addresses : string[1] = "world"


# This category represents the rule to identify a given board :
#
# Each board belongs to the "board.gc" category (type=100)
# and its address is composed of one unique"board" integral
# number (>=0).

# This category represents the rule to identify the PCB of a given board :
#
# The PCB belongs to the "board_pcb.gc" category (type=200)
# and its address is composed of the same "board" integral
# number (>=0) that identifies its mother boards. This is a
# kind of inheritance relationship.

# This category represents the rule to identify a given mezzanine
# board on its mother board :

# The mezzanine board belongs to the "mezzanine.gc" category (type=1000).
# As a mother board can host several mezzanine boards, the address of a
# mezzanine board is composed not only by the "board" number of its
# mother board, but also by an additionnal "daughter" number that uniquely
# identifies the mezzanine on the mother board.
