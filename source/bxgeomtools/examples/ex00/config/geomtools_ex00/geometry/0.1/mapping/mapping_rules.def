[model="world" policy="supersede"]

# Here all the boxes of model "box0.model" that have been set in the world
# volume (directly or indireclty through dedicated *replicated* models)
# are considered to be classified (and labelled) in the same geometry
# category: "box.gc". The numbering start arbitrarily from 0 (for
# daughter "BoxA") and runs up to 17 (to the last box in the "CircleBoxes"
# replica model).

#@description The mapping directives for the "BoxA" daughter volume
mapping.daughter_id.BoxA : string  = "[box.gc:position=0]"
# This builds the [100:0] GID.

#@description The mapping directives for the "BoxB" daughter volume
mapping.daughter_id.BoxB : string  = "[box.gc:position=1]"
# This builds the [100:1] GID.

#@description The mapping directives for the "BoxC" daughter volume
mapping.daughter_id.BoxC : string  = "[box.gc:position=2]"
# This builds the [100:2] GID.

#@description The mapping directives for the "BoxD" daughter volume
mapping.daughter_id.BoxD : string  = "[box.gc:position=3]"
# This builds the [100:3] GID.

#@description The mapping directives for the "BoxE" daughter volume
mapping.daughter_id.BoxE : string  = "[box.gc:position=4]"
# This builds the [100:4] GID.

#@description The mapping directives for the "ManyBoxes" daughter volume
mapping.daughter_id.ManyBoxes : string  = "[box.gc:position+5]"
# This  builds  the following  4  GIDS  : [100:5],  [100:6],  [100:7],
# [100:8], respectively associated to  each replicated box addressed by
# the ManyBoxes volume.

#@description The mapping directives for the "CircleBoxes" daughter volume
mapping.daughter_id.CircleBoxes : string  = "[box.gc:position+9]"
# This  builds  the  following  9   GIDS  from  [100:9]  to  [100:17],
# respectively  associated to  each  replicated box  addressed by  the
# CircleBoxes volume.

#@description The mapping directives for the "CylA" daughter volume
