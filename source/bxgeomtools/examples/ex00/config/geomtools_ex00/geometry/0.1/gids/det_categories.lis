#@key_label   "category"
#@meta_label  "type"


##############################
[category="box.gc" type="100"]

#@config The geometry category associated to simple box volumes

#@description The GID address of a box is characterized by its 'position' number
addresses : string[1] = "position"
# Example: [100:0], [100:1]... [100:5] are GIDs associated to 6 different box
# volumes, each with their own position number.


################################
[category="brick.gc" type="200"]

#@config The geometry category associated to brick volumes in a wall

#@description The GID address of a brick is characterized by its 'column' and 'row' numbers in the wall
addresses : string[2] = "column" "row"
# Example: [200:2.3] is the GID associated to a brick volume in third column
# and fourth row in a wall.


#####################################
[category="any_column.gc" type="300"]

#@config The geometry category associated to some column of objects, subset of a 2D grid pattern

#@description The GID address of a column of nodes is characterized by its 'column' number
addresses : string[1] = "column"


###################################
[category="any_node.gc" type="310"]

#@config The geometry category associated to some volumes on a 2D grid pattern

#@description The GID address of a volume at a given node inherits the "column" number of the column it belongs to
extends : string = "any_column.gc"

#@description The GID address is extended by an additional address, i.e. 'row' number of the node in the column
by : string[1] = "row"


###################################
[category="detector.gc" type="400"]

#@config The geometry category associated to a detection unit

#@description The GID address of a detector is characterized by its 'unit' number
addresses : string[1] = "unit"


#####################################
[category="attenuator.gc" type="410"]

#@config The geometry category associated to the attenuator in a detection unit

#@description The GID address of an attenuator is characterized in the same way the detector unit it belongs to
inherits : string = "detector.gc"


####################################
[category="collector.gc" type="420"]

#@config The geometry category associated to the collector in a detection unit

#@description The GID address of a collector is characterized in the same way the detector unit it belongs to
inherits : string = "detector.gc"


#################################
[category="sensor.gc" type="430"]

#@config The geometry category associated to sensors volumes in a detection unit

#@description The GID address of a sensor volume inherits the 'unit' number of the detector unit it belongs too
extends : string = "detector.gc"

#@description The GID address is extended by an additional address, i.e. 'position' number of the sensor along the detector stack
by : string[1] = "position"

# end of file.
