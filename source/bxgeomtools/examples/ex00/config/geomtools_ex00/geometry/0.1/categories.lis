###########################
[category="world" type="0"]

#@config The mandatory geometry category of the top-level world volume

#@description The GID address of the world volume is characterized by its 'world' number
addresses : string[1] = "world"

# This is mandatory in the library, by convention :
#  the category name is : 'world'
#  the type Id is: 0


##############################
[category="box.gc" type="100"]

#@config The geometry category associated to simple box volumes

#@description The GID address of a box is characterized by its 'position' number
addresses : string[1] = "position"


################################
[category="brick.gc" type="200"]

#@config The geometry category associated to brick volumes in a wall

#@description The GID address of a brick is characterized by its 'column' and 'row' numbers in the wall
addresses : string[2] = "column" "row"


#####################################
[category="any_column.gc" type="300"]

#@config The geometry category associated to some column, subset of a 2D grid pattern

#@description The GID address of a column of nodes is characterized by its 'column' number
addresses : string[1] = "column"


###################################
[category="any_node.gc" type="310"]

#@config The geometry category associated to some volumes on a 2D grid pattern

#@description The GID address of a volume at a given node inherits the "column" number \
 of the column it belongs to
extends : string = "any_column.gc"

#@description The GID address is extended by an additional address, i.e. 'row' number \
 of the node in the column
by : string[1] = "row"
