# List of geometry ID categories/types (datatools::multi_properties):

#@description A  list of geometry ID categories/types
#@key_label   "category"
#@meta_label  "type"

# We define here the couples of mapping categories and types for all the geometry
# setup. Each geometry category is unique as well as the type (integer number)
# that is associated to it. Such a category is a human readable character string
# of which the name should be chosen to be self explanatory. We recommend to
# use the ".gc" (geometry category) suffix when chosing the name of a category.
# Examples:
#  * "shielding_brick.gc" : the category for all physical volumes representing
#     a shield brick in the setup (at a given hierarchy level).
#  * "bolt.gc" : the category for all physical volumes representing a bolt (at
#     a given hierarchy level).

# [category="world" type="0"]

# #@config The mandatory geometry category of the top-level world volume

# #@description The GID address of the world volume is characterized by its 'world' number
# addresses : string[1] = "world"

# This is mandatory in the library, by convention the category name is 'world' (reserved name)
# and the associated type ID is 0 (reserved type).
# The unique associated GID to the top level world volume is thus: [type=0:world=0].
# In future implementation of Bayeux/geomtools, some alternative parallel worlds
# could be given world numbers 1, 2... with associated GIDs : [0:1], [0:2]...
# Such a feature is not implement for now.

[category="object.gc" type="10"]

addresses : string[1] = "item"

# Physical volume associated to this category are identified
# by their type and an unique item number, following the scheme: [type=10:item=N]
# where N is an positive or null integer:
#  * [10:0] : first object
#  * [10:1] : second object
#  * ...      other objects
#  * [10:8] : ninth object
# Note that physical volumes addressed by such GID mapping scheme do not need
# to have the same logical model (shape and material). It is just a way to
# attribute a unique identifier to volume that can be considered at the same
# hierarchy level with respect to the hierarchy of mother volumes.
