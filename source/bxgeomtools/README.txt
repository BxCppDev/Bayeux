geomtools is a  C++ library which provides some basic geometry classes and
tools for geometric modelling and management.

geomtools depends on  the materials and mygsl C++ libraries.  It relies on
some CLHEP classes and is compatible with GDML and GEANT4 concepts.

geomtools is  distributed as a module of the  Bayeux  software
suite.
