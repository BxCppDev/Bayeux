Bayeux/materials is a  C++ program library that  proposes some classes
to   represent  and   manipulate  isotopes,   chemical  elements   and
materials. It  is compatible  with the GDML  and GEANT4  approach.  It
also provides a database of definitions for basic materials.

It depends on the Bayeux/datatools program library (>=5.0.0).

Bayeux/materials is  distributed as  a module  of the  Bayeux software
suite.
