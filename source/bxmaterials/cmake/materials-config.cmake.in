#  materials_LIBRARY      - libraries to link against
#  materials_BIO_LIBRARY  - library targets to link against (Boost I/O library)
#  materials_REFLECTION_LIBRARY - library targets to link against (reflection library)
#  materials_LIBRARIES    - libraries to link against
#  materials_WITH_BIO     - flag for Boost/Serialization I/O DLL (a.k.a. 'bio')
#  materials_WITH_REFLECTION  - flag for reflection DLL
