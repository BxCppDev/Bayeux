Development of genbb_help has migrated to Git


The  Bayeux/genbb_help   C++  library  is  built   from  the  original
Genbb/Decay0  program  by  Vladimir  Tretyak,  a  Fortran  application
dedicated  to  the  generation  of  double  beta  decays  and  various
radioactive nuclei of interest.

Some reader C++ class (the ``genbb::genbb_mgr`` class) enables the use
of output data files generated by the original *Genbb* program.  Other
generator classes  have been implemented  as C++ wrappers of  the core
Fortran   generator   (the  ``genbb::genbb``   and   ``genbb::wgenbb``
classes).

The current version of Bayeux/genbb_help  now implements a C++ port of
the  original Fortran  code (Fortran  and CERNLIB  free) and  add some
extensions.   More  generators,  with  respect  to  Genbb/Decay0,  are
thus available.

Bayeux/genbb_help is a component  library of the Bayeux software
suite.
