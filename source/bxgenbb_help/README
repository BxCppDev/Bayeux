This is the 'genbb_help' package README file

1 - Description:

    GENBB wrapper package.
    The GENBB Fortran library has been extracted from the
    N3Nemos CVS repository. A 'genbb' script is provided to run
    the generator.

    Some reader C++ class (genbb_mgr) enables to use the output
    data file from 'genbb'.

2 - Documentation:

    Please use the 'scripts/genbb' script:

    shell>$ genbb --help


3 - Installation:

   Step 1:
  
     cd in the root directory of the 'genbb_help' package 
     (i.e. the directory where you have found this README file).

   Step 2:

     run the pkgtool program using the 'configure' command:

     shell>$ ./pkgtools.d/pkgtool configure
     Configure package 'genbb_help': nothing special...

     the default implementation does nothing! 

   Step 3:

     run the pkgtool program using the 'build' command to build
     the shared library provided by the package:

     shell>$ ./pkgtools.d/pkgtool build


   Step 4:

     run the pkgtool program using the 'build' command to build
     the executables (sample/test/production programs) provided 
     by the package:

     shell>$ ./pkgtools.d/pkgtool build bin

   Step 5:

     run the pkgtool program using the 'install' command to generate
     startup scripts suitable for your environment setup: 

     shell>$ ./pkgtools.d/pkgtool install

     read carefully the installation hints.

   Step 6:

     source the 'genbb_help.sh' (or 'genbb_help.csh') from your
     shell to setup proper environment variables (PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH...)

     For sh shell:
       shell>$ source genbb_help.sh

     or for csh shells:
       shell>$ source genbb_help.csh


     You may prefer to source these files from your startup 
     scripts (~/.bashrc, ~/.cshrc...)

   Step 7:

     check the running of the 'genbb_help-config' program:

     shell>$ genbb_help-config

4 - Uninstallation:

   To uninstall:
 
     shell>$ ./pkgtools.d/pkgtool uninstall

     it will remove autogenerated setup files and give you some hints.

   To 'clean' the software:
 
     shell>$ ./pkgtools.d/pkgtool clean

     it will remove object/executable and other dummy files (*~).

5 - Maintenance and bug report:
