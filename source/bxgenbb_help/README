This is the 'genbb_help' package README file


1 - Description:

    GENBB wrapper package.
    The GENBB Fortran library has been extracted from the
    N3Nemos CVS repository. A 'genbb' script is provided to run
    the generator.

    Some reader C++ class (genbb_mgr) enables to use the output
    data file from 'genbb'.


2 - Documentation:

    Please use the 'scripts/genbb' script:

    shell>$ genbb --help
    See also section 5 of this file.
    
    Note:
    2009-04-02 FM:
    We met some unexplained problems with some no 
    mandatory Fortran part of the library. 
    This has been removed.
    
    

3 - Installation:

   Step 1:
  
     cd in the root directory of the 'genbb_help' package 
     (i.e. the directory where you have found this README file).

   Step 2:

     run the pkgtool program using the 'configure' command:

     shell>$ ./pkgtools.d/pkgtool -v configure
     pkgtool (genbb_help): INFO: Configure package 'genbb_help': setting F77 compiler...
     pkgtool (genbb_help): INFO: Package 'genbb_help' build will use 'gfortran'

     shell>$ cat .genbb_help.conf 
     export F77_COMP=gfortran

   Step 2':

     to use g77 in place of gfortran:

     shell>$ ./pkgtools.d/pkgtool -v --g77 configure

   Step 3:

     run the pkgtool program using the 'build' command to build
     the shared library provided by the package:

     shell>$ ./pkgtools.d/pkgtool -v build
     pkgtool (genbb_help): INFO: Build package 'genbb_help'...
     pkgtool (genbb_help): INFO: Build procedure use the 'gfortran' F77 compiler...
     pkgtool (genbb_help): INFO: Build gmk...


   Step 4:

     run the pkgtool program using the 'build' command to build
     the executables (sample/test/production programs) provided 
     by the package:

     shell>$ ./pkgtools.d/pkgtool build bin

   Step 5:

     run the pkgtool program using the 'install' command to generate
     startup scripts suitable for your environment setup: 

     shell>$ ./pkgtools.d/pkgtool install

     read carefully the installation hints.

   Step 6:

     source the 'genbb_help.sh' (or 'genbb_help.csh') from your
     shell to setup proper environment variables (PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH...)

     For sh shell:
       shell>$ source genbb_help.sh

     or for csh shells:
       shell>$ source genbb_help.csh


     You may prefer to source these files from your startup 
     scripts (~/.bashrc, ~/.cshrc...)

   Step 7:

     check the running of the 'genbb_help-config' program:

     shell>$ genbb_help-config


4 - Uninstallation:

   To uninstall:
 
     shell>$ ./pkgtools.d/pkgtool uninstall

     it will remove autogenerated setup files and give you some hints.

   To 'clean' the software:
 
     shell>$ ./pkgtools.d/pkgtool clean

     it will remove object/executable and other dummy files (*~).


5 - Usage:

   A configuration file is needed to make genbb generate
   primary simulation events from the genbb library:

   Typical usage is:

     shell>$ genbb \
         bipo212.conf \
         314159 \
         100 \
         bipo212_out.data

   Where:

      bipo212.conf      is the configuration file
      314159            is the random seed
      100               is the number of generated events
      bipo212_out.data  is the output data file
