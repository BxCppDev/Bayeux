About Bayeux
============

.. _Bayeux: https://github.com/BxCppDev/Bayeux

Bayeux_ provides  a collection of  C++ classes and  functions designed
for the  simulation, recording and  analysis of data  for experimental
particle  and nuclear  physics  projects.   These functionalities  are
splitted into several specialized submodules:

datatools
  Generic data  structures with  Boost serialization support  and core
  utilities  for software  configuration and  management (support  for
  variant configurations, object factories, service management...).

brio
  A *Boost/serialization over ROOT  I/O* system (extends datatools I/O
  tools).

cuts
  Generic tools for making arbitrary data selections.

materials
  Description  of isotopes,  elements and  materials, providing
  input to simulation applications (i.e. GDML/Geant4).

mygsl
  C++ wrappers to the  GNU Scientific Library and extension for
  numerical tools.

dpp
  A basic data processing pipeline API with support for processor and service plugins.

geomtools
  Generic tools for the modelling of experimental geometries,
  providing input to simulation tools (i.e. GDML/Geant4).

emfield
  Electromagnetic field modelling and management.

genbb(_help)
  C++ port and  extensions to the Genbb/Decay0 program by
  Vladimir Tretyak, providing input to simulation applications.
  Depends on the external BxDecay0_ library (optional).

genvtx
  Vertex  random  generator tools providing input to  simulation
  applications.

mctools
  Utilities for particle and nuclear physics simulation with
  a Geant4 interface.

lahague
  Utilities for dosimetry and radiation protection (optional).

Bayeux's roots
--------------

Original work on Bayeux was  initiated at the `Laboratoire de Physique
Corpusculaire de  Caen`_ (CNRS/IN2P3)  in the  framework of  the NEMO3
double-beta  decay  experiment and  the  R&D  for its  successor:  the
SuperNEMO experiment.  Bayeux  is developped by a  group of physicists
working in Nuclear  and Particle Physics. It  provides generic classes
and tools that can be used in  many different contexts.  It is now the
cornerstone of the SuperNEMO_  experiment's production software chain.
As a  generic toolbox,  it is  also used by  several projects  for the
simulation of  particle transport  through matter (through  its Geant4
extension  module), detector  design  for  nuclear physics,  detection
efficiency  calculation,  data   serialization,  data  processing  and
analysis,  radiation  protection   and  dosimetry  studies  (including
industrial projects).

.. _Linuxbrew: https://github.com/topics/linuxbrew

Naming and logo
---------------

Bayeux is  named thus  because it weaves  together several  threads of
software developed in Normandy ;-).

The use of the Bayeux name and logo (an extract of the lower frieze of
the Bayeux Tapestry) have been  courteously authorized by the Mayor of
the  City of  Bayeux  in December  2014 at  the  condition the  Bayeux
software tools are distributed under an open source software license.

This  authorization  is explicitely  granted  to  the
`Laboratoire de Physique Corpusculaire de Caen`_
(UMR6534,  CNRS/IN2P3,  UNICAEN, ENSICAEN, Normandie Univ.).

Licensing
---------

Please study the  file ``LICENSE.txt`` for the  distribution terms and
conditions of use of Bayeux.

Bayeux contains some code extracted  from :

* the *Kitware System* library (OSI-approved BSD License),
* the *BinReloc* library (Do  What The Fuck You Want To Public License, Version  2),
* the *EOS portable archive* library (MIT License).

Vladimir Tretyak has kindly accepted that the C++ wrapper and C++ port
of the  original Genbb/Decay0 Fortran  library is published  under the
GPL 3 within Bayeux.

Some parts of code or  management/build scripts are released under the
MIT License.

All other parts of Bayeux's C++ source code are released under the GNU
General Public License 3.0.


Supported environments
----------------------

Bayeux  is expected  to work  on modern  Linux distributions  based on
Debian  or Fedora,  as Linux  is our  main development  and production
environment.  Other  UNIX-like OSes  (Linux, BSD, macOS)  **may** work
with some work of adapting.

Bayeux uses the C++11 standard by default so this implies the use of a
modern C++ compiler (example: GCC version >= 4.9).

You may  use a dedicated `Linuxbrew`_  *tap* like the one  proposed by
the BxCppDev_  group (`bxcppdev/bxtap`_). It  may help you to  setup a
suitable  working environment  on  your system.   However we  consider
Linuxbrew as  error-prone and we recommend  to use as far  as possible
the package manager of your system.   You may also consider to use the
Spack_ package manager to satisfy Bayeux's software dependencies.

Getting Help
============

If you have problems, questions, ideas or suggestions on Bayeux or any
of  its submodules,  please contact  the BxCppDev  Group via  the main
development  platform   https://github.com/BxCppDev.   You   may  also
contact  the Bayeux  team  at bayeux@lpccaen.in2p3.fr  (in English  or
French).



Getting Bayeux
===============

You can  obtain the Bayeux source  code from the main  BxCppDev GitHub
repository.

For example, to download Bayeux version 3.4.1, you may use, assuming a
Linux system:

.. code:: sh

   $ cd ${HOME}
   $ mkdir -p ${HOME}/BxCppDev
   $ cd ${HOME}/BxCppDev
   $ wget https://github.com/BxCppDev/Bayeux/archive/3.4.1.tar.gz
   $ mkdir Bayeux-3.4.1 && tar xvzf 3.4.1.tar.gz -C Bayeux-3.4.1 --strip-components 1
   $ cd Bayeux-3.4.1/
..


The  ``${HOME}/BxCppDev/Bayeux-3.4.1/``   source  directory   is  thus
created.

You  can  now create  a  dedicated  directory  to build  Bayeux  3.4.1
following  the guidelines  in the  *Installing Bayeux*  section below.
Note that  different versions  of Bayeux  may have  slightly different
build/installation  procedures,  so  you  should  read  carefully  the
``README.rst`` file supplied with the source code.


If you  want to use  the development version (possibly  unstable), please use
Git:

.. code:: sh

   $ cd ${HOME}
   $ mkdir -p ${HOME}/BxCppDev
   $ cd ${HOME}/BxCppDev
   $ git clone https://github.com/BxCppDev/Bayeux Bayeux.git
   $ cd Bayeux.git
   $ git checkout develop
..

Preparing Your System for Bayeux Installation
==============================================

To install Bayeux, you first need the following software:

Prerequisite Software
---------------------

UNIX Operating System
.....................

*  Linux
*  macOS 10.9 (Mavericks) or higher

We expect  Bayeux to  work on  most modern BSD  based Unices  or Linux
distributions  derived from  Debian and Fedora (RedHat) provided  the
software listed below is installed. However, we can only fully support
and test the following at present:

-  Ubuntu 16.04LTS (deprecated but should work), 18.04LTS, 20.04LTS (current development system):
   http://www.ubuntu.com
-  CentOS 7.5: https://www.centos.org/

If you have problems on systems other than these, please contact us,
though support will be on a best effort basis.

Core Software Required
......................

* CMake 3.10.2 or higher: http://www.cmake.org
  
  * Ubuntu 18.04 provides CMake version 3.10.2.
  * Ubuntu 20.04 provides CMake version 3.16.3.

* C/C++ compiler supporting at least C++11 standard
  (GNU/Clang/Intel)
  
  * Ubuntu 18.04 provides GCC version 6.5 and 7.3.
  * Ubuntu 20.04 provides GCC version 9.3.

  
On Linux,  you should  install these through  the package  manager for
your distribution. Some older  Linux systems (SL/CentOS, especially on
institutional computing clusters) may  not provide CMake  3.3. If this  is the case,  then you
should download the latest Linux *binary .sh* file (example: ``cmake-3.17.2-Linux-x86_64.sh``) from:

  http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

and follow the instructions on that page to install it.

On macOS, simply install CMake from the latest ``Darwin64`` dmg
bundle available from:

  http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

To obtain the other tools, simply  install the latest version of Xcode
from the  Mac App Store.  After installation, you should  also install
the Xcode command line tools via going to the menu Xcode->Preferences,
clicking on the Downloads tab, and then installing Command Line Tools.

Core Libraries Required
.......................

* Boost  1.63.0, 1.69.0, 1.71.0:  http://www.boost.org  with the  following
  libraries:    filesystem,    system,    serialization,    iostreams,
  program_options, regex and thread.

  * Ubuntu 18.04 provides broken (for Bayeux) version 1.65.0 
  * Ubuntu 20.04 provides version 1.71.0 (libboost-all-dev)

  **Beware**: Boost versions 1.65 (default on Ubuntu 18.04) to 1.68 are
  expected to  cause some crash with  GCC under Linux due  to a subtle
  bug concerning the Boost/Serialization singleton class. Boost 1.69 should
  fix this issue.
  
* Camp >=0.8.2 : https://github.com/IRCAD-IHU/camp
  
  * Ubuntu 18.04 does not provide Camp
  * Ubuntu 20.04 provides version 0.8.4 (libcamp-dev)

* GSL 2.1 or higher: http://www.gnu.org/s/gsl

  * Ubuntu 18.04 provides version 2.4 (libgsl-dev)
  * Ubuntu 20.04 provides version 2.5 (libgsl-dev)
  
* CLHEP 2.1.3.1, 2.1.4.2, 2.4.1.0: http://proj-clhep.web.cern.ch
  
  * Ubuntu 18.04 does not provide CLHEP
  * Ubuntu 20.04   provides   version   2.1.4.1   (libclhep-dev)   but
    unfortunately  this  version has  no  CMake  support so  you  should
    install this library by yourself.
 
* Geant4 9.6 (optional) : http://geant4.cern.ch
  with GDML support enabled (through the XercesC library)

  **Warning:** Geant4 version 10.5 support is not ready (issue #43).

  You must install Geant4 and its associated datasets by yourself.
  Please do not use internal CLHEP build but the CLHEP system or manual
  install above.

* Xerces-C (optional, needed for GDML support and Geant4 bridge)
 
  * Ubuntu 20.04 provides version 3.2.2 (libxerces-c-dev)

* ROOT 6.12.04 or 6.16.00: http://root.cern.ch
  Bayeux/geomtools requires you setup ROOT at least with support for:

  * minimal X11,
  * GDML,
  * OpenGL.

  You must install ROOT by yourself. 

* Qt5 (optional)

  * Ubuntu 20.04 provides version 5.12.8 (libqt5core5a, libqt5gui5, libqt5widgets5)

* BxDecay0 1.0.2 (optional, see below) : https://github.com/BxCppDev/bxdecay0

  You must install BxDecay0 by yourself. 

  **Remark** : This  C++ port of the legacy Fortran  decay0 program is
  now  an  independant  project  which has  been  extracted  from  the
  ``Bayeux/genbb_help module``.  BxDecay0 will become in a near future
  the only Decay0 C++ port supported  by Bayeux. Bayeux will use it as
  an external dependency.
  

Install dependencies with LinuxBrew
...................................


**Deprecated**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For ease  of use,  the BxCppDev  group provides  the `bxcppdev/bxtap`_
Linuxbrew tap  for easy use  by Bayeux, Bayeux companion  software and
clients of Bayeux.  It is advised to use this bundle if you don't know
how to  install and  setup the dependee  libraries mentioned  above on
your system.  It will provide, for Linux and macOS systems, an uniform
software  environment  with  a   selected  set  of  blessed  software,
including the C++ compiler if needed.

Note however that it is  perfectly possible to use system installation
of  the above  libraries  if your  OS  distribution provides  adequate
support.

**Beware:** We have  experienced that the use of Linuxbrew  is not the
definitive robust  solution to solve the  software dependency problem.
Linuxbrew regularly fails  to provide a proper  and stable environment
to host  and use  Bayeux, due  to rapidly  changing brew  formulas and
their dependencies from the homebrew core  tap.  We try to provide the
proper formulas for Ubuntu Linux. However you could be forced to adapt
some formulas to your own system.

  

Install dependencies with Spack
...................................

Work under progress.


Additional Software Required
............................

* Bayeux/datatools requires the Qt5 library when the ``BAYEUX_WITH_QT_GUI``
  option is set (experimental).

  On Ubuntu 18.04/20.04, this implies the installation of the following packages:

  .. code:: sh

     $ sudo apt-get install libqt5core5a libqt5gui5 libqt5svg5 \
	    libqt5svg5-dev libqt5widgets5  \
	    qt5-default
  ..

  .. **Note:** bxcppdev/bxtap provides a ``qt5-base`` formula.
  
* Bayeux/geomtools also requires Gnuplot 4.0 or higher: http://www.gnuplot.info

  On Ubuntu 18.04/20.04, this implies the installation of the following packages:

  .. code:: sh

     $ sudo apt-get install gnuplot 
  ..

  Gnuplot uses by default the ``gnuplot-qt`` interface. You may want to use the ``gnuplot-x11`` package.

* Bayeux/datatools and Bayeux/geomtools uses the Readline library, if available:

  * http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html
  * http://askubuntu.com/questions/194523/how-do-i-install-gnu-readline

  On Ubuntu 20.04, this implies the installation of the following packages:

  .. code:: sh

     $ sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev
  ..

* pandoc (http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) is  useful to generate
  documentation in user friendly format:

  On Ubuntu, this implies  the installation of the following
  packages:

  .. code:: sh

     $ sudo apt-get install pandoc
  ..

* docutils  (http://docutils.sourceforge.net/)  is also  useful  to
  generate documentation from ReST format in user friendly format:

  On Ubuntu, this implies the installation of the following packages:

  .. code:: sh

     $ sudo apt-get install python-docutils
     $ sudo apt-get install rst2pdf
  ..

Known Issues on Tested Platforms
--------------------------------


- Boost/Serialization library  from version  1.65 to 1.68  introduced a
  bug  in the  implementation of  the singleton  template class.  As a
  consequence, only Boost version 1.63 and 1.69 and above should be supported so far.
- Despite our efforts, Geant4 10.5 (no  MT build) is not supported yet
  since  the implementation  of  hit collections  has  changed in  some
  undocumented  way (as usual with Geant4!) and  now  causes  segfault  in the  Bayeux/mctools
  Geant4 extension module.

Installing Bayeux
=================

Bayeux provides a CMake_ based  build system. We'll assume for brevity
that you are using  a UNIX system on the command  line (i.e.  macOS or
Linux).   We'll also  assume that  you're going  to use  the Linuxbrew
`bxcppdev/bxtap`_ tap to provide some required third party packages.

.. _`bxcppdev/bxtap`: https://github.com/BxCppDev/homebrew_bxtap
.. _CMake: http://www.cmake.org

Configuring the Installation
----------------------------

The directory in which this  ``README.rst`` file resides is called the
"source directory"  of Bayeux. Because  CMake generates many  files as
part of the configuration and  build process, we perform configuration
in a directory isolated from the  source directory. This enables us to
quickly clean  up in  the event  of issues,  and prevents  commital of
generated (and hence system dependent) files to the repository.

To configure Bayeux, simply do, from the source directory of Bayeux:

.. code:: sh

   $ mkdir Bayeux-build
   $ cd Bayeux-build/
   $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<where you want to install> \
	   -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path to your Linuxbrew install> \
	   ..
..

You may also  use an arbitrary temporary build  directory somewhere in
your filesystem:

.. code:: sh

   $ mkdir /tmp/Bayeux-build
   $ cd /tmp/Bayeux-build
   $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<where you want to install> \
	   -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path to your Linuxbrew install> \
	   <path to the Bayeux source directory>
..

CMake Configuration Options
---------------------------

These options control the underlying CMake system, a full list can be
obtained from the CMake documentation, but in Bayeux you will only need
to deal with the following three in most cases:

``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``
  Path under which to install Bayeux. It should point to an empty,
  writable directory. It defaults to ``/usr/local`` so you will want
  to change this.

``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``
  Path under which  Linuxbrew is installed and where  some of the
  third party software (dependencies) should be searched for.
  You can use the following to automatically locate Linuxbrew on your system:

  .. code:: sh

     $ cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$(brew --prefix)


``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE``
  Build type, e.g. ``Release``, ``Debug``. You will want this to be
  set  to ``Release``  in most  cases. ``Debug``  builds are  only
  needed if you  are needing to follow debugging  symbols into one
  of   Linuxbrew's  thid   party  binaries.    It  defaults   to
  ``Release``, so you will not need to change it in most cases.

Note also  that you can  ask CMake to use  the Ninja_ build  system in
place of the legacy ``make`` command. Use the ``-GNinja`` switch with your
CMake command:

.. code:: sh

   $ cmake ... -GNinja ...
..

.. _Ninja: https://ninja-build.org/

  ..  
 
Building and Installing
-----------------------

Once  you have  generated the  build system  for Bayeux,  as described
earlier, you are ready to build.  Note that if you want to reconfigure
at  any  time, you  can  simply  run  ``ccmake``  again in  the  build
directory.

By default Bayeux  generates a Makefile based system, so  to build and
install Bayeux, simply run:

.. code:: sh

   $ make [-j4]
   $ make install
..

where ``-j4`` indicates  the number of processors to be  used to build
Bayeux.

If you  chose Ninja as the  build system, please replace  the ``make``
command above by ``ninja`` :

.. code:: sh

   $ ninja [-j4]
   $ ninja install
..

Running test
------------

In order  to run the  test programs  provided with the  various Bayeux
submodules,  you should  have activated  the ``BAYEUX_ENABLE_TESTING``
configuration option. From the build directory, simply run:

.. code:: sh

   $ make test
..

or

.. code:: sh

   $ ninja test
..


.. raw:: pdf

   PageBreak oneColumn
..


Setup
-----

In order  to setup Bayeux  on your system,  we recommend to  provide a
bayeux  activation  shell  function  from  your  Bash  startup  script
(i.e. ``~/.bashrc``):

.. code:: sh
 
   function bayeux_setup()
   {
      if [ -n "${BAYEUX_INSTALL_DIR}" ]; then
	  echo >&2 "[error] bayeux_setup: Bayeux is already setup!"
	  return 2
      fi     
      export BAYEUX_INSTALL_DIR="/path/to/Bayeux/installation/dir"
      export PATH="${BAYEUX_INSTALL_DIR}/bin:${PATH}"
      echo >&2 "[info] bayeux_setup: Bayeux $(bxquery --version) is now setup!"
      return 0
   }
   export -f bayeux_setup	  
..

When you need to use the Bayeux software from a bare Bash shell,
just type:

.. code:: sh

   $ bayeux_setup
..

The ``bxquery`` utility should help you to locate the resources
provided by Bayeux:

.. code:: sh

   $ bxquery --help
..

Fell free to provide a ``bayeux_unsetup`` shell function to come back to
the initial state of the shell.


Documentation
===============

Bayeux is built with *some* documentation, although incomplete:

* From the  installation directory, provided  the ``BAYEUX_WITH_DOCS``
  and ``BAYEUX_WITH_DOCS_OCD`` options have been enabled, one can find
  a set of  Doxygen generated HTML pages. The main  page is located in
  ``share/Bayeux-{Bayeux's
  version}/Documentation/API/html/index.html``   from   the   Bayeux's
  installation directory.
* The Bayeux  source code  provides some test  programs that  *may* be
  used as sample code. However, it is not their original purpose.
* Bayeux  modules  contains some  example  code  implemented as  small
  project. See the source code for example in ``share/Bayeux-{Bayeux's
  version}/examples/`` from the Bayeux's installation directory.
  
Troubleshooting

WIP


Using Bayeux
============


A note on RPATHs
----------------

You should not use  the ``(DY)LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` variables because they
are  intended  for testing,  not  production  (see  the man  pages  of
ld/dyld).   Bayeux uses  **rpaths**  to provide  a  simple setup  that
allows  applications  to  be  run  directly  with  guaranteed  library
lookup. Morever, relative rpaths are  used that generally allow Bayeux
to be relocatable (albeit not tested).

However, these settings are platform dependent and CMake has only added
support for this gradually. In particular, see these references:

* Kitware Blog article on macOS RPATH handling (http://www.kitware.com/blog/home/post/510)
* Handling macOS RPATH on older CMake

  (http://www.mail-archive.com/cmake@cmake.org/msg47143.html)
* CMake's general RPATH handling (http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_RPATH_handling)

Note also  that if you  have ``(DY)LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` set, you  may see
startup errors if any of the  paths contains libraries used by Bayeux,
e.g. ROOT.  In general, you should never need to set the library path,
though many scientific software projects (badly mis)use it.


To do
=====

* Provide official example code for many classes.
* Migrate some deprecated  Boost classes to some  C++11 classes (smart
  pointers...)

Acknowledgements
================

The authors gratefully thank the following persons for their direct or
indirect contributions to the Bayeux library:

* Vladimir  Tretyak  is  the  author of  the  original  *Genbb/Decay0*
  generator (written in  Fortran 77) from which  a significant portion
  of the Bayeux/genbb_help module is derived.
* Christian Pfligersdorffer  is the author of  the Boost/Serialization
  *portable  binary archive*  classes which  is supported  by the  I/O
  system of the Bayeux/datatools and Bayeux/brio modules.
* Nicolas Devillard and Rajarshi Guha  are the authors of the *Gnuplot
  pipe* library that is embedded in Bayeux/geomtools.
* Sylvette Lemagnen (Curator at the  Bayeux Museum) and Patrick Gomont
  (Mayor  of the  City  of  Bayeux) for  their  authorization for  the
  library's name and logo.
